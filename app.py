st.markdown ("""Hi! I am Sweet Pinky T. Martinez. I graduated from Kitcharao National High School, where I got to join lots of math competitions to represent my school. I‚Äôve always loved numbers and solving problems, so it was really exciting to compete and challenge myself.

When I am not studying or competing, I love playing volleyball and playing musical instruments. Both of these hobbies let me stay active and creative, and I enjoy every minute of it.

I also really love dogs, and I have a lot of them at home! They bring so much joy to my life, and I am always there for them.

Right now, I am focused on becoming a successful programmer. I want to build my own company someday and make a real impact with the things I create. I‚Äôm working hard to learn as much as I can to make this dream a reality.""",
